# modern_armor [mod]

The modern_armor mod is part of the modern_armor modpack by Poikilos.

3d_armor_character+Poikilos_CharacterSquare.blend based on 3d_armor_character.blend


## Special cases
- The boots utilize the lower part and bottom of the leggings (which are usually never utilized) rather than the texture area which shows the actual "boots" which are more bulky.


## Differences from upstream models
- ~~Make a gap of .02 for the legs (.01 on each side) to accommodate the second skin layer (bottom of square texture).~~
- Copy skin layer 1 to create layer 2, and expand it maximally (.01 less than armor; See readme-skins.md).
- Change UVs (See [3d_armor_character.md](3d_armor_character.md)).
